<h2 class="mt-5"> Evergreen</h2>
<p> a plant that retains its leaves through the year and into the following growing season. Many tropical species of broad-leaved flowering plants are evergreen, but in cold-temperate and Arctic areas the evergreens commonly are cone-bearing shrubs or trees (conifers), such as pines and firs.</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">Tree</h2>
<p> a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">Shrubs</h2>
<p> a woody plant that has several stems, none dominant, and is usually less than 3 m (10 feet) tall. When much-branched and dense, it may be called a bush. Intermediate between shrubs and trees are arborescences, or treelike shrubs, from 3 to 6 m tall.</p>
